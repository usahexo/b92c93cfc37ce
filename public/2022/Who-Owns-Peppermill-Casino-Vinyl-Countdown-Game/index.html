        <h1 id="Who-Owns-Peppermill-Casino-Vinyl-Countdown-Game"><a href="#Who-Owns-Peppermill-Casino-Vinyl-Countdown-Game" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns Peppermill Casino Vinyl Countdown Game?"></a>Who Owns Peppermill Casino Vinyl Countdown Game?</h1><p>In the early days of gaming, there were very few dedicated game development studios. As a result, many older games are simply conversions of popular board games or card games. One such game is Peppermill Casino, originally released in 1984 for the Atari 2600. The game is a basic tile-based puzzle game with a casino theme.</p>
<p>Like most Atari 2600 games, Peppermill Casino was developed by only a handful of people. While the exact details are unknown, it is generally accepted that Jay Miner was one of the key developers on the game. Miner was responsible for the design of the Atari 2600 console and many of its popular early games.</p>
<p>After over 30 years, Peppermill Casino is once again available to play. This time, however, it’s been remastered for modern platforms as part of the Atari Flashback Classics series. The remastered version includes new graphics and sound effects, as well as online leaderboards and achievements.</p>
<p>Despite being such an old game, Peppermill Casino remains popular to this day. In fact, it was recently featured on an episode of The Vinyl Countdown, a show about classic video games hosted by John Riggs. During the episode, Riggs interviews Jay Miner about the development of Peppermill Casino and other classic Atari 2600 games.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while Miner is usually associated with developing video games, he actually started his career as a chip designer at Commodore International. It was there that he met Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari and one of the pioneers of the video game industry. After leaving Commodore, Miner started working for Atari where he designed some of their most popular early titles.</p>
<p>So who owns Peppermill Casino? Well, Jay Miner certainly played a key role in its development and Commodore International was one of its original publishers. However, as with most old video games, the exact ownership is difficult to determine. In any case, it’s safe to say that everyone involved in its creation can be proud of what turned out to be a classic title</p>
<h1 id="Peppermill-Casino-Vinyl-Countdown-Game-Ownership-Unclear"><a href="#Peppermill-Casino-Vinyl-Countdown-Game-Ownership-Unclear" class="headerlink" title="Peppermill Casino Vinyl Countdown Game Ownership Unclear"></a>Peppermill Casino Vinyl Countdown Game Ownership Unclear</h1><p>The Peppermill Casino in Reno, Nevada is the scene of a new game that is currently being offered to guests, Vinyl Countdown. The game has guests spinning a large vinyl record to see if they can land on a particular spot which will then result in winning a prize.</p>
<p>There are some questions as to who actually owns the game however. While the casino says it is their game and they are the ones offering the prizes, some people close to the matter say that it was actually created by a man named Bob Quigley who owns a company called InVision Game Company.</p>
<p>Quigley apparently came up with the game a few years ago and has been touring it around various casinos. It is said that the Peppermill Casino officials saw the game being played at another casino and decided they wanted to offer it as their own.</p>
<p>So far, it doesn’t appear that there has been any legal action taken over the matter, but it will certainly be interesting to see how things play out. In the meantime, if you’re in Reno and want to try your luck at Vinyl Countdown, head on over to the Peppermill Casino!</p>
