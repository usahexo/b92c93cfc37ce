<p>Officials are trying to work out how much of the casinos’ income should be taxed, given that the chips themselves are not considered taxable assets.</p>
<p>Casinos could owe millions of dollars in back taxes if the IRS determines that a large proportion of their revenues are from chip sales.</p>
<p>The investigation was prompted by concerns that the growing popularity of casino games, such as blackjack and roulette, has led to increased profits for the industry.</p>
<p>In a letter to casino operators, the IRS said it was looking into “the determination of gross income from gaming and wagering activities”.</p>
<p>The agency said it wanted to know more about how chips are used in gambling transactions, and asked casino operators to provide information on what portion of their income came from chip sales.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the American Gaming Association said the trade group was working with its members to comply with the IRS request.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-tax-could-bring-in-millions-for-the-government"><a href="#Gambling-tax-could-bring-in-millions-for-the-government" class="headerlink" title="Gambling tax could bring in millions for the government"></a>Gambling tax could bring in millions for the government</h1><p>:date: December 6, 2018</p>
<p>The UK government is considering plans to introduce a gambling tax in a bid to raise millions of pounds for the treasury.</p>
<p>Under the proposed plans, betting firms would be taxed at a rate of 20% on profits from bets placed in the UK. The government is hoping that the new tax will help it to raise an additional £500 million per year.</p>
<p>The gambling tax proposal was announced by Chancellor Philip Hammond in his Autumn Budget statement last month. Hammond said that the new tax would help to protect vulnerable people and children who are “at risk” from gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The move has been welcomed by anti-gambling campaigners, who have long argued that the gambling industry should be subject to tighter regulation. However, the proposals have come under fire from betting firms, who claim that they will lead to job losses and increased prices for consumers.</p>
<p>If introduced, the gambling tax would be one of the biggest taxes of its kind in Europe. Other countries that levy a gambling tax include Denmark (25%), Germany (19%), Spain (16%) and Sweden (18%).</p>
<p>The UK government has not yet confirmed when the gambling tax will come into effect, but it is expected to be introduced in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Osborne-considers-tax-on-casino-chips"><a href="#Osborne-considers-tax-on-casino-chips" class="headerlink" title="Osborne considers tax on casino chips"></a>Osborne considers tax on casino chips</h1><p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has announced that he is considering a tax on casino chips in order to raise money for the government.</p>
<p>The move is likely to be welcomed by many people, as it would help to crackdown on gambling and raise money for the Treasury. However, it could also lead to problems for casinos, as players may be less inclined to gamble if they have to pay tax on their winnings.</p>
<p>Osborne made his comments during a speech at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester. He said that the government is looking at a number of ways to raise money, including a new tax on casino chips.</p>
<p>He added that the government is also considering increasing taxes on alcohol and petrol, as well as introducing a new levy on banks. However, he ruled out increasing income tax or VAT.</p>
<p>The Chancellor’s comments come at a time when the government is under pressure to reduce its deficit. The Labour Party has accused Osborne of taking an “ideological approach” to taxation, which is causing damage to the economy.</p>
<p>Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has said that Labour would reverse many of the government’s cuts if it was elected in 2015.</p>
<h1 id="Government-mulls-over-plans-to-introduce-gambling-tax"><a href="#Government-mulls-over-plans-to-introduce-gambling-tax" class="headerlink" title="Government mulls over plans to introduce gambling tax"></a>Government mulls over plans to introduce gambling tax</h1><p>The government has announced plans to introduce a gambling tax in order to raise additional revenue. The new tax would be levied on operators of gambling venues and online gambling sites, with the aim of raising £100 million per year.</p>
<p>The proposal has been met with criticism from the gambling industry, which argues that it will lead to job losses and reduced investment in the sector. However, the government insists that the tax is necessary in order to ensure that gambling is treated fairly alongside other forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said that Labour would support a gambling tax if it was introduced in a “fair” way, and that any resulting job losses would need to be mitigated.</p>
<p>The government has not yet announced any specific details about the proposed tax, such as the rates that would be applied. However, it is thought that it would be similar to the existing taxes on betting and gaming machines.</p>
<p>Gambling is currently taxed at different levels in different parts of the UK. In England and Wales, betting profits are subject to a levy of 15%, while gaming machine profits are taxed at a rate of 20%. In Scotland, betting profits are taxed at 12%, while gaming machine profits are taxed at 25%.</p>
<p>The government’s plans come amid rising pressure on its finances, with debts reaching £1.8 trillion earlier this year.</p>

<p>The government is looking into a number of ways to shore up the tax system, and minister for financial services Kelly O’Dwyer said gambling would be included in a review of the tax system.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that everyone is paying their fair share of tax, and that includes those who profit from gambling,” she said.</p>
<p>The review will look at whether winnings and chips should be taxed as income, goods or services, or whether a new tax should be introduced on gambling profits.</p>
<p>It is estimated that Australians lost more than $24 billion to gambling in 2016-17, with just over $6 billion being paid out in prizes.</p>
<p>Gambling industry analysts say the government could raise up to $1.5 billion a year in extra tax revenue from taxing casino winnings and chips.</p>
