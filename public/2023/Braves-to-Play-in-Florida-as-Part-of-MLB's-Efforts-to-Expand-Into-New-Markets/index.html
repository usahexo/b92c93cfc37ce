      Braves to Play in Florida as Part of MLB&#39;s Efforts to Expand Into New Markets

        <h1 id="Braves-to-Play-in-Florida-as-Part-of-MLB’s-Efforts-to-Expand-Into-New-Markets"><a href="#Braves-to-Play-in-Florida-as-Part-of-MLB’s-Efforts-to-Expand-Into-New-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Braves to Play in Florida as Part of MLB’s Efforts to Expand Into New Markets"></a>Braves to Play in Florida as Part of MLB’s Efforts to Expand Into New Markets</h1><p>The Atlanta Braves will be moving their spring training operations to North Port, Florida in 2020, as part of Major League Baseball’s (MLB) efforts to expand its reach into new markets. The team is one of several that will be relocating their operations to new locations in order to tap into untapped fan bases.</p>
<p>“This move is about giving our players the best chance to succeed,” said Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos. “The new environment and facilities in North Port will help us prepare for the season.”</p>
<p>The Braves are one of several teams that MLB has been encouraging to relocate their spring training operations in order to expand the sport’s footprint. Other teams that have announced moves include the Boston Red Sox (to Fort Myers, Florida), the New York Yankees (to Tampa, Florida), and the Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies (both to Scottsdale, Arizona).</p>
<p>While baseball is considered a regional sport in the United States, its popularity is growing in other parts of the world. In November 2018, MLB announced plans to create a new international league that would play its games in Mexico. The league, which is expected to debut in 2020, will be comprised of eight teams from Mexico and Japan.</p>
<h1 id="Atlanta-Braves-to-Begin-Playing-Games-in-Florida-This-Spring"><a href="#Atlanta-Braves-to-Begin-Playing-Games-in-Florida-This-Spring" class="headerlink" title="Atlanta Braves to Begin Playing Games in Florida This Spring"></a>Atlanta Braves to Begin Playing Games in Florida This Spring</h1><p>The Atlanta Braves announced on Thursday that the team will begin playing its spring training games in Florida this year. The Braves have played their spring training games in Arizona for the past two decades, but the new stadium being built in Cobb County, just outside of Atlanta, will not be ready in time for the team’s pitchers and catchers to report in February.</p>
<p>The Braves informed county and state officials in Florida that they were interested in playing some games at one of the state’s ballparks, and officials with the St. Lucie Mets, who are affiliated with the New York Mets, offered their ballpark in Port St. Lucie. The Braves will play a total of 10 games at the stadium, which can hold 7,000 fans.</p>
<p>“After much due diligence and many conversations amongst our organization we have decided to take our exhibition games to Florida this year,” said Braves President John Schuerholz in a statement. “We appreciate all that has been done by our partners in Arizona to provide our players and staff with top-notch facilities over the past 20 years and we look forward to returning to Desert Diamond Stadium in 2017.”</p>
<p>The team also announced that it will play an exhibition game against Team Canada on March 29th at Montreal’s Olympic Stadium. That game was originally scheduled for Turner Field before it was announced that the Braves would be moving out of Atlanta after the 2016 season.</p>
<h1 id="Braves-Returning-to-Florida-For-the-First-Time-Since-1997"><a href="#Braves-Returning-to-Florida-For-the-First-Time-Since-1997" class="headerlink" title="Braves Returning to Florida For the First Time Since 1997"></a>Braves Returning to Florida For the First Time Since 1997</h1><p>The Atlanta Braves are set to return to Florida for the first time since 1997. The team will play a three-game series against the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park in Miami.</p>
<p>This will be the first time that the Braves have played in Miami since they moved to Atlanta in 1966. The Braves have played a number of games in Tampa Bay over the years, but this will be their first series in Miami.</p>
<p>The Braves were founded in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings. The team moved to Milwaukee in 1953 and then to Atlanta in 1966. The Braves are a member of the National League East division.</p>
<p>The Marlins were founded in 1993 and are also a member of the National League East division. The Marlins won the World Series in 1997 and 2003.</p>
<p>The Braves and Marlins have met 149 times, with the Braves winning 83 of those games. The first meeting between the two teams took place on April 5, 1993, with the Marlins winning 11-4.</p>
<p>Tickets for this series are already sold out.</p>
<h1 id="Braves-Set-to-Begin-Playing-Games-in-Florida-This-March"><a href="#Braves-Set-to-Begin-Playing-Games-in-Florida-This-March" class="headerlink" title="Braves Set to Begin Playing Games in Florida This March"></a>Braves Set to Begin Playing Games in Florida This March</h1><p>The Atlanta Braves are scheduled to play their first game in Florida this coming March. The team is relocating from Georgia due to a controversial stadium deal between the team and the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p>Some feel that the team is leaving its fans in the lurch, as there are currently no plans to replace the Braves stadium in Atlanta. Others argue that the new stadium will be a boon for taxpayers, as they will not have to pay for its construction or upkeep.</p>
<p>Regardless of where one stands on this issue, it is clear that the Braves relocation will have a major impact on both the team and the city of Atlanta.</p>
<h1 id="Braves-Announce-Plans-To-Play-In-Florida"><a href="#Braves-Announce-Plans-To-Play-In-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Braves Announce Plans To Play In Florida"></a>Braves Announce Plans To Play In Florida</h1><p>The Atlanta Braves announced today that they will be moving their operations to Florida in order to take advantage of the warmer climate. The team is expected to play their home games in the city of Miami starting in the 2020 season.</p>
<p>“This was a difficult decision for us, but we feel that it is the best move for the long-term success of our organization,” said Braves Chairman and CEO Terry McGuirk.</p>
<p>The Braves have been playing in Atlanta since 1966, but the team has been dealing with poor attendance and mounting financial losses in recent years. McGuirk said that the Miami market provides a much better opportunity for the Braves to grow their fan base and revenue.</p>
<p>The move will come as a shock to many Braves fans, who are used to watching their team play at Turner Field. But McGuirk stressed that the new stadium in Miami will be a “world-class facility” that will be worth traveling to see.</p>
<p>The Miami Marlins are expected to give up their current stadium, Marlins Park, so that the Braves can move in. The Marlins are currently owned by Derek Jeter, who has been trying to sell the team for months. It is not yet clear what plans Jeter has for Marlins Park if the Braves move in.</p>
