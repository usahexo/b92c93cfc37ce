#  1-18 different roulette games pay out at 22Bet!

22Bet is one the best, if not the best, places to play roulette games. Not only do they offer a variety of different roulette variants, but they all payout at a rate of 92.3%. So whatever your game of choice may be, you can be sure that you’ll get a fair shake at 22Bet.

Let’s take a look at some of the different roulette games that are available:

American Roulette – The classic game that we’ve all come to know and love. This variant features 38 slots, two of which are the House pockets. Players can bet on a range of different outcomes, including whether the ball will land in red or black, odd or even, or a range of numbers.

European Roulette – This game is similar to American Roulette, but with a key difference: There is only one House pocket (0), as opposed to two in American Roulette. This makes for a more thrilling experience as players are less likely to lose all their chips in one go.

French Roulette – French Roulette is essentially European Roulette with an extra betting option known as La Partage. When betting on this option, players are essentially splitting their bet in half if the ball lands in the 0 slot. For example, if you bet €10 on La Partage and the ball lands in 0, you would win back €5 instead of losing your entire bet.

3D Roulette – 3D Roulette is our personal favourite here at 22Bet! This variant offers an immersive 3D experience that gives players an edge over traditional 2D roulette games. In addition to the amazing graphics, 3D Roulette also features an extra betting option known as Neighbour Bets. This allows players to make bets on neighbouring numbers on the wheel for increased winning potential!

Other popular variants include Premier Racing Roulette (featuring realistic car racing visuals) and Multi-Wheel Roulette (which lets you play up to 8 different wheels simultaneously). Whichever game tickles your fancy, we guarantee that you won’t be disappointed with what 22Bet has to offer!

## How to Play

First, choose your bet amount. Place your chips on the number(s) you want to bet on. Once the dealer has put the ball in motion, watch as it spins around the wheel and eventually falls into one of the numbered slots. If your number appears on the ball and on the roulette table, you win!

If you don't want to keep track of all of this yourself, many online casinos offer a "live casino" which projects a real life dealer who spins the wheel and calls out winning numbers. You can also chat with other players at your table.

## Winning Strategy

There's no surefire way to win at roulette, but some strategies are better than others. The most basic strategy is simply to pick a number or two and bet on them consistently. This can be risky, but if you hit your numbers often enough you can walk away with a healthy payout.

Another strategy is called "doubling up." When you double up, you place a bet that's twice as large as your previous bet. So if you lost your last bet, you would place a new bet that's twice as large as that one. If you win, you get back what you lost plus the original wager; if you lose, you lose everything. This strategy is less risky than betting on a single number, but it also offers less potential for payouts.

Whatever strategy you choose, always remember to stay within your budget and never gamble more than you can afford to lose. Roulette can be fun and exciting, but it's important to play safe too. Have fun and good luck!
