#  What is the Lost Game?

The Lost Game is a board game that has been lost to history. Little is known about the game, but what is known suggests it was a complex and strategic game.

The only remaining evidence of the Lost Game is a single fragment of a playing board, discovered in a desert in North Africa. The fragment is thought to be from the 6th century AD, and contains enough information to reconstruct a playing board.

The fragment shows that the game was played on a 12x12 board, with four player pieces per side. The object of the game is unknown, but it is thought to be complex and highly strategic.

Despite its obscurity, the Lost Game has received some attention from modern gamers. In 2011, an online community called "The Lost Game Project" was launched with the goal of reconstructing the game based on the fragmentary evidence available.
