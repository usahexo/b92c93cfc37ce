#  When does Football 3X3 start?

Football 3X3 is a new and fast-growing sport that is played by teams of three players on a small rectangular court. The sport has been recognised by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) as an official sport, and in June 2017, the first international tournament was held in Rome.

The sport is now being played in over 60 countries worldwide, and there are plans to introduce it as an event at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. In order to help promote this new sport, here’s everything you need to know about Football 3X3.

How do you play Football 3X3?

The game is played between two teams of three players, with each team trying to score goals against the other team. There are no goalkeepers in Football 3X3, and the pitch is much smaller than a traditional football pitch, measuring just 20 metres long by 10 metres wide.

A match consists of two halves of 10 minutes each, with a five-minute break in between. If the score is still level after 30 minutes of play, then an extra period of two minutes will be played. If the scores are still level after this period, then sudden death will be used to determine the winner. In sudden death, the first team to score wins the match.

What are the rules of Football 3X3?

There are a few differences between Football 3X3 and traditional football. Firstly, there are no offsides in Football 3X3, meaning players can run wherever they like on the pitch. Secondly, fouls are punished differently - instead of giving away a free kick, a player who commits a foul is given a yellow card and temporarily suspended from play. A player who receives two yellow cards is automatically sent off and replaced by another player from their team.

Finally, defenders cannot hold onto attackers or impede their progress in any way - if this happens then a free kick is awarded to the attacking team. Other rules such as handball and corner kicks apply as they do in traditional football.

Who plays Football 3X3?

Football 3X3 is a relatively new sport, so not many professional players have taken up playing it yet! However, there are some well-known names who have shown an interest in playing the game including Neymar Jr., Paul Pogba and Eden Hazard. At grassroots level, the sport is growing rapidly and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities.
