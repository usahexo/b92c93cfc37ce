#  Top Republicans express opposition to online gambling – The Hill

Dozens of top Republicans, including many in Congress, have come out against online gambling in a letter to the acting assistant attorney general.

The letter, organized by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), was sent on Thursday and argues that the Department of Justice’s revised opinion on the Wire Act “will create tremendous ambiguity and harm state interests.”

Signatories include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

“We write to express our strong opposition to the Department of Justice’s recent reinterpretation of the Wire Act, which would effectively legalize online gambling across the United States,” the lawmakers wrote.

In January, the DOJ issued a memo stating that the Wire Act only applies to sports betting, not other types of online gambling. The new opinion opened up the possibility for states to legalize and regulate games like poker and roulette.

But the Republican lawmakers argue that such a move would violate state sovereignty and encroach on consumer protections. They also note that there is no evidence that online gambling is less risky than traditional forms of the activity.

#  GOP lawmakers want new restrictions on internet gambling – Politico

The Republican National Committee passed a resolution this week calling for new federal restrictions on internet gambling, reigniting a long-standing debate over how to regulate the practice.

The resolution, adopted unanimously by the RNC’s Resolutions Committee on Monday, calls on Congress to pass legislation prohibiting online gaming “except in states that expressly authorize it.”

It also urges state legislatures to do the same, and calls on the Trump administration to issue guidance stating that internet gambling is illegal under federal law.

The push for new restrictions comes as the Trump administration considers whether to reverse an Obama-era policy that paved the way for more widespread online gambling.

In 2011, the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel issued a memorandum concluding that a law banning most sports betting did not apply to other forms of gambling taking place over the internet.

That memo opened the door for states like Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware to legalize internet gambling within their borders. Pennsylvania and West Virginia have since followed suit.

But some Republican lawmakers have argued that the decision was based on a flawed interpretation of the law, and they are now pushing for a new legislative fix.

“Congress never meant for online casinos to exist outside state boundaries and without federal oversight,” said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), who has introduced legislation banning internet gambling. “These casinos threaten our economy and our communities by allowing bad actors to facilitate illegal gambling with little fear of prosecution.”

#  Some Republicans break ranks on gambling issue – AP

Some Republicans in the US are breaking ranks with the party’s stance against gambling, opening the prospect of new casinos and sports betting in states where it is currently illegal.

The move comes as some states look to legalize gambling as a way to raise revenue, and as the gambling industry ramps up its efforts to overturn a federal ban on most sports betting.

In Pennsylvania, Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman is pushing for the legalization of casinos, while in New Hampshire, House Speaker Gene Chandler has voiced support for repealing that state’s anti-gambling law.

“I think our positions are changing because public opinion has changed and there are more and more people who see it as an acceptable way to spend their leisure time and also generate some economic activity,” said Chandler.

While there has been growing bipartisan support for legalizing gambling, many Republicans remain opposed, fearing that it will lead to increased addiction and social ills.

#  Nevada Senator blasts Republican colleagues over online gambling stance – Las Vegas Sun

In a scathing speech on the Senate floor yesterday, Nevada Senator Harry Reid blasted his Republican colleagues for their efforts to repeal online gambling. Calling the move "hypocritical and shameful", Reid accused his fellow senators of being in the pocket of casino magnates like Sheldon Adelson.

Adelson, who is one of the biggest opponents of online gambling, has been lobbying hard for the repeal, which is included in the proposed omnibus spending bill. Reid argued that the measure would cost thousands of jobs in his home state and deprive millions of Americans of a legitimate form of entertainment.

"The Republicans are in a panic because they see that the American people are on our side," he said. " They know that if this issue is brought to a vote, it will be defeated."

Reid also criticized his Republican colleagues for trying to sneak the repeal through without a vote. "They're so afraid of their own members they don't want them to have a chance to vote on this issue," he said. "What kind of nonsense is that?"

He ended his speech by urging his colleagues to reject the bill and uphold the will of the people.

#  Republican Governors divided on online gambling – Reuters

Republican governors are divided over whether to support or oppose online gambling, which is now legal in three states and could soon be legal in many more.

Governors in some states, such as Ohio and Missouri, say they oppose all forms of gambling, including online gambling. Governors in other states, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, say they support online gambling but want to make sure it is tightly regulated.

The issue is likely to come up during the National Governors Association meeting this weekend in Washington D.C.

Supporters of online gambling argue that it can help generate tax revenue and create jobs. Opponents argue that it can lead to addiction and social problems.

Some Republican governors are also opposed to legalizing marijuana, another issue that is likely to come up during the NGA meeting.
