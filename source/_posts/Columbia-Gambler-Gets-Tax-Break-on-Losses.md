#  Columbia Gambler Gets Tax Break on Losses

A New York City man who gambles at least $5,000 per year on activities like blackjack, poker and horse racing is getting a $600 tax break this year.

The man, who asked to remain anonymous, told the New York Daily News he has been gambling for more than two decades and always makes sure to lose more than he wins.

“I know how the game works,” he said.

New York State is one of a number of states that offer tax breaks to gamblers who can prove they lost more money than they won. In New York, taxpayers can deduct up to $400 in gambling losses each year.

The Columbia gambler’s strategy seems to be working well – he says he usually loses about $2,000 annually. That deduction will save him about $120 in taxes this year.

Tax experts say the strategy can be a smart move for those who can afford to lose the money.

“If you have extra money that you can afford to lose, it might make sense for you to do this each year and get the tax write-off,” said certified public accountant Dean Ferrara.



Gambling has been around for centuries and is a popular pastime for many people around the world. While some people gamble for entertainment purposes only, others see it as a way to make money. And then there are those who gamble purely with the intention of losing so they can claim a tax deduction.

Meet “Columbia” – an anonymous New Yorker who has been gambling regularly for over two decades in order to take advantage of his state’s tax laws. Because New York allows taxpayers to deduct up to $400 in gambling losses each year, Columbia deliberately bets and loses more than he wins in order to get a bigger tax break. This year alone, his gambling losses will save him over $120 in taxes!

While some people may think it’s foolishness not to win more when you’re gambling with someone else’s money, Columbia knows the game all too well and is content with breaking even most years. In fact, he typically loses about $2,000 annually – which means his big deductions just keep getting bigger!

#  Columbia Considers Tax Deduction for Gambling Losses

The state of New York is considering a new bill that would allow individuals to deduct gambling losses from their state income taxes. The proposed legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, would give tax relief to those who gamble in the hopes of winning money.

"This is a matter of fairness," Pretlow said in a statement. "People who lose money gambling should be able to get some relief on their taxes."

Under the proposed bill, taxpayers could deduct up to $10,000 in gambling losses each year. The deduction would be available to both residents and non-residents of New York State.

Supporters of the bill argue that it would help stimulate the state's gaming industry, which has been struggling in recent years. They also say that it would provide some relief to taxpayers who have suffered financial losses as a result of gambling.

Opponents of the bill argue that it would encourage more people to gamble, and that it would be difficult to enforce. They also argue that gambling is an addiction for many people, and that they should not be rewarded for their bad habits.

The bill is currently pending before the New York State Assembly's Ways and Means Committee.

#  Mayor Announces New Tax Deduction for Gambling Losses

In a move that is sure to please the city's gambling community, Mayor Bloomberg today announced a new tax deduction for gambling losses. The deduction, which will become effective starting next year, will allow individuals to deduct up to $10,000 in gambling losses from their taxable income.

"This new deduction will make it more affordable for New Yorkers to gamble, and that will help our city's economy continue to grow," said Mayor Bloomberg. "It's also great news for the thousands of people who work in the city's casinos and hotels."

Critics of the mayor's initiative claim that it will encourage more people to gamble, which could lead to increased crime and social problems. But the mayor dismissed those concerns, saying that "gambling is a legal activity and we should do everything we can to make it as affordable as possible."

The new deduction is expected to cost the city $100 million in lost tax revenue Per year. But Mayor Bloomberg believes that the benefits of increased gambling spending will outweigh the costs. "This is a smart investment in our city's future," he said.

#  Columbia Gambling Losses May be Tax Deductible

According to the latest reports, gambling losses in Columbia may be tax deductible. This comes as a relief to many casino players in the city, who can now offset their losses against other taxable income. The news was announced by Mayor James Trapp at a press conference on Wednesday.

"We are committed to creating an environment that is conducive to economic growth," said Mayor Trapp. "This new rule will encourage more people to visit our casinos, and it will help to create jobs and boost the local economy."

Under the new rule, casino players in Columbia can deduct up to $5,000 in gambling losses from their taxable income each year. This is good news for taxpayers, who can now recoup some of their losses without having to pay taxes on them.

Critics of the rule say that it will lead to more gambling addiction problems in Columbia. But Mayor Trapp disagrees. "I don't think this will increase gambling addiction," he said. "People who are addicted to gambling will find a way to gamble no matter what the rules are."

Others argue that the rule could actually help to reduce gambling addiction rates in Columbia. By allowing players to deduct their losses from their taxable income, they may be less likely to continue gambling if they are losing money. This could help people to avoid getting into serious financial trouble because of their gambling habit.

The new rule is scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2017.

#  Columbia Considers Allowing Gambling Losses as a Tax Deduction

The recent tax reform bill, passed by the Republican-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in December 2017, has created some controversy. Among the provisions of the new bill is one that allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in gambling losses from their taxable income. The provision was lobbied for by the casino industry, which claims that it will help create jobs.

Critics of the provision say that it is a gift to the casino industry at the expense of taxpayers. They argue that allowing people to deduct gambling losses from their taxable income will lead to more gambling and increase the amount of money that the government loses in taxes.

The provision has sparked a debate in Columbia, South Carolina, where lawmakers are considering whether to allow residents to deductible gambling losses from their taxable income. A state Senate committee recently held a hearing on a bill that would do just that. The bill was introduced by State Senator Darrell Jackson, a Democrat who represents Richland County.

Senator Jackson said that he introduced the bill because he wanted to give people in his district “the same opportunity as everyone else in America” to benefit from the new tax law. He noted that many people in his district work in the casino industry and could benefit from the deduction.

Critics of the bill argue that it will lead to more gambling and increased government losses in taxes. They also argue that it is unfair because it benefits people who can afford to gamble and lose money, while those who cannot afford to gamble will have to bear the burden of paying more taxes.

 Supporters of the bill say that it will help create jobs in the casino industry and stimulate economic growth. They also argue that it is fair because everyone has an equal opportunity to benefit from it.
