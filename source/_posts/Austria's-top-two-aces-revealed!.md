#  Austria's top two aces revealed!

Austria's top two aces have been revealed and they come as no surprise to many! With Max Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel both being household names, it is clear to see why Austria has such high hopes for the two.

Having already dominated in testing, it is clear that both drivers are keen to get the season off to a good start. Verstappen was excited to get back in the car after the winter break. "It was really nice to be back in the car and driving again. The tests went well and we were able to do a lot of laps, which is always important."

Vettel echoed his sentiments, adding that he was happy with how the team had performed so far. "I think we had a good winter test. I'm happy with how things went; we did a lot of laps and tried a lot of different things."

The two drivers are no strangers to one another, having already battled out on track on several occasions. But with both drivers now being in different teams, there will undoubtedly be even more competition between them.

It is clear that Austria is eagerly anticipating the start of the Formula One season, with fans hoping that Verstappen and Vettel can bring home some much-needed glory for the country.

#  Blackjack Austria: What are the odds of getting two aces?

If you're having a night out at the casino and playing blackjack in Austria, you might be curious about what the odds of getting two aces are. Blackjack is typically played with six decks of cards, which means there are 312 possible card combinations.

There are only four ways to get two aces, so the odds of getting two aces in any given hand are 1 in 312. That's not too bad, but if you're looking to make some serious money at the casino, blackjack probably isn't your game.

#  How to ace blackjack in Austria

In Austria, blackjack is played with six decks of cards. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting as close to 21 as possible, or by having a higher total value than the dealer.

To play blackjack in Austria, you first need to place a bet. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards to each player and two cards to themselves. The player's two cards are face-up, while the dealer's first card is face-down.

The player then has two options: they can either 'stand' (i.e. keep their current total) or they can 'hit' (i.e. draw another card). If the player's total is higher than the dealer's first card, then they win (provided that their second card doesn't take them over 21).

If the player busts (i.e. their total exceeds 21), then they lose regardless of whether or not the dealer subsequently busts too. The game ends when either all players have either bust or stood, or when the dealer's second card is revealed and it determines that no more cards are needed from either player - known as a 'push'.

Basic strategy for blackjack recommends that you always stand if your total is 17 or higher, and always hit if your total is 16 or lower. There are exceptions to this rule - for example, some charts recommend hitting on totals of 12 - but following these basic guidelines will give you a good starting point for playing blackjack in Austria.
